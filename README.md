You're a busy business person, so why not give yourself some brain space and put your schedule down. That's where Work Day Scheduler (WDS) comes into play. A nifty web applicaiton that let's you put down all your important appointments and to-dos for the day to come. Or maybe you need to build your calender the night before. The data persists locally so until you clear your schedule, your calender will remain 


## Installation

Clone with HTTPS, or feel free to use the hosted [Work Day Scheduler App](https://clubkemp.github.io/uw-schedule).


## Usage 

1. If opening WDS for the first time, the world is your oyster, fill in the time slots as needed
2. If you want to save the text for a particular time slot, click the blue save button on the right
3. that text will now be saved until you delete it and save again. Don't worry, if you refresh or close the page it will still be there
4. If your day is over, give yourself a pat on the back, crack a brew, and reset your calendar for the next day with the big green button at the top of the page.
